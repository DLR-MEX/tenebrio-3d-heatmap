# Real-Time 3D Room Temperature & Humidity Heatmap

A Python application that generates a real-time 3D volumetric heatmap of a mealworm breeding room using temperature and humidity data received from Ubidots via MQTT.

## Project Overview

This system monitors the internal temperature and humidity distribution of a Tenebrio molitor breeding room using 5 interior sensors and 1 exterior sensor. It produces an interactive 3D heatmap that updates in real time, allowing operators to detect thermal gradients, hot spots, and cold zones. The dashboard supports toggling between temperature and humidity views.

## Features

- Real-time MQTT subscription to Ubidots IoT platform
- 3D volumetric interpolation using scipy griddata (temperature and humidity)
- Toggle between Temperature and Humidity 3D heatmap views
- Interactive Plotly.js dashboard with isosurface rendering
- Historical data viewer with timeline slider (fetches from Ubidots API)
- Exterior temperature monitoring (tex sensor) with colored zone in 3D render
- Average temperature indicators (superior/inferior)
- Humidity monitoring (h1–h5, hum_general) with color-coded bars
- Ammonia (PPM) monitoring with color-coded bar
- Per-sensor vertical thermometer indicators with interpolated colors
- Fan and extractor animated SVG widgets
- Ideal range markers on temperature (23–28°C) and humidity (60–88%) bars
- MQTT connection status and timestamp display
- 3D wireframe: inclined roof, windows, furniture, vintage lamps, planter
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile portrait and landscape)
- Branded UI with TECHNEBRIOS and Ingenieria Condor logos
- Orbitron font for timestamp display
- Auto-refresh every 2 seconds

## System Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture diagram and component descriptions.

```
Sensors → MQTT Client → Heatmap Engine → Flask API → Frontend (Plotly.js)
```

## Installation

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/main.py
```

## API

See [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) for endpoint documentation.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /` | Dashboard with 3D heatmap |
| `GET /api/data` | JSON data for real-time visualization |
| `GET /api/history` | Historical data from Ubidots |
| `GET /api/history/interpolate` | Server-side interpolation for historical frames |

## Simulation Mode (Local Testing)

For testing without a real Ubidots device, use the simulator with a local MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto):

1. Start your local broker (e.g., `mosquitto`).
2. Update `backend/config.py`:
   ```python
   MQTT_BROKER = "localhost"
   UBIDOTS_TOKEN = ""
   ```
3. In one terminal: `python mqtt_simulator.py`
4. In another terminal: `python backend/main.py`

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
